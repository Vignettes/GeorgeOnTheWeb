Fancy seeing you here on the Web!

My name is [George Wolf](</notes/George Wolf.md>) and my passion is <em>encouraging innovation</em>.
This site is my digital filing cabinet. 
The trick is that I forgot to buy folders, but I did staple some files into packets. 

I created this to stay focused on my [Why](/notes/why.md).
Which became a place to talk about [Projects](/notes/projects.md) and [Hobbies](/notes/hobbies.md)

[Agility](/notes/agility.md) fit in as a topic related to projects. 

And the [Reflections](/notes/reflections.md) keep me aligned to my values.
