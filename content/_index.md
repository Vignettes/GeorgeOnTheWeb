The [Stoics](/George/stoics.md) advice seems to go against the modern world. 
How does one live in the present when our lives demand a plan for the future, require big long-term projects and depend on people outside of our influence?

My name is [George Wolf](/George/George%20Wolf.md) and my passion is <em>creating, enabling and encouraging innovation</em>.
This site is my digital filing cabinet. 
The trick is that I forgot to buy folders, but I did staple some files into packets. 

I created this to stay focused on my [Why](/George/George%20Wolf.md#Why?).
Which became a place to talk about [Projects](/George/projects.md).

The [Reflections](/George/reflections.md) keep me aligned to my values.
