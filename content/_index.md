The [stoics](/notes/stoicism.md) advice seems to go against the modern world. 
How does one live in the present when our lives demand a plan for the future, require big long-term projects and depend on people outside of our influence?

My name is [George Wolf](/notes/George%20Wolf.md) and my passion is <em>creating, enabling and encouraging innovation</em>.
This site is my digital filing cabinet. 
The trick is that I forgot to buy folders, but I did staple some files into packets. 

I created this to stay focused on my [Why](/notes/why.md).
Which became a place to talk about [Projects](/notes/projects.md) and [Hobbies](/notes/hobbies.md)

[Agility](/notes/agility.md) fit in as a topic related to projects. Which also meant [Entrepreneurship](/notes/entrepreneurship.md) got pulled in.

And the [Reflections](/notes/reflections.md) keep me aligned to my values.
