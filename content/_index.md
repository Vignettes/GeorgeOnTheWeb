My name is [George Wolf](/notes/GeorgeWolf.md) and my passion is <em>creating, enabling and encouraging innovation</em>.
This site is my digital filing cabinet. 
The trick is that I forgot to buy folders, but I did staple some files into packets. 

I created this to stay focused on my [Why](/notes/GeorgeWolf.md#Why?).
Which became a place to talk about [Projects](/notes/projects.md).

The [Reflections](/notes/reflections.md) keep me aligned to my values.
