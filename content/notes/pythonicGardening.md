# Why?
I found that I was delaying adding notes to my digital garden if it took much time out of my day. Most of the time I just want to create a quick note in the moment and come back to it later. 

That could be solved with a tool like [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) and some plugins, but what I am after is [minimalism in computing](https://web.archive.org/web/20210122160226/https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2016-08-25-minimalism-computing/).
